For putting together the ctat mutations pipe release, we need to do the following:

# GitHub

## devel branch: 

- update the version tag to the planned release version

- update the CHANGELOG.txt to include updates and release notes reflected in this release.

- commit to devel branch

### under Docker/

- update the VERSION.txt file to the latest version number.

- update the Dockerfile so it pulls the specific commit ID corresponding to this release.

- build and push the latest docker using the shell scripts in the Docker folder: ./build_docker.sh && ./push_docker.sh && push_docker.latest.sh

- update the testing/Makefile ‘HC_standard_docker’ target so that it works with the current docker image - and verify it works with the current docker image.  

- build a singularity image by running ./make_simg.sh, which will build the image ctat_mutations.v${VERSION}.simg

- copy the singularity image to gs://trinityctatmutations/SINGULARITY/. 

- on Broad’s internal servers, copy the simg file here: /seq/RNASEQ/public_ftp/CTAT_SINGULARITY/CTAT_MUTATIONS/.   and then it should automatically show up as available here: https://data.broadinstitute.org/Trinity/CTAT_SINGULARITY/CTAT_MUTATIONS/

- update the GitHub wiki for Docker and Singularity usage to match the current version:  https://github.com/NCIP/ctat-mutations/wiki/ctat_mutations_docker_singularity 

## master branch:

- ‘git pull origin devel && git push' which should end up being a fast-forward commit to resync the master branch to the latest code.

- make an official release https://github.com/NCIP/ctat-mutations/releases using the same release naming and versioning conventions used for the others.

- add the CHANGELOG section for this release to the release notes here.

## other GitHub wiki documentation updates:

- be sure that the usage info https://github.com/NCIP/ctat-mutations/wiki  and https://github.com/NCIP/ctat-mutations/wiki/CTAT-mutations-installation  are current given any changes in the software for this release.

# Terra:

- test on Terra to make sure it runs and results are accurate.

- deploy latest release on Terra and update any documentation

# Google forum announcement:

- make a release announcement on our Trinity CTAT google forum:   You can look at other release announcements posted there to see formatting and match the current announcement formatting - pretty basic.
